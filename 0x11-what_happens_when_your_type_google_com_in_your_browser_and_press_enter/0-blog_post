{. Navigating the Web: A Simplified Journey .}

Ever wondered what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit Enter? Let's break down the process into simpler terms, exploring the key steps in the web stack.

1. DNS Request:
Your browser asks a DNS server to convert "www.google.com" into an IP address.

2. TCP/IP:
A connection is established between your browser and the server using TCP/IP, ensuring reliable data transfer.

3. Firewall:
Firewalls monitor and control incoming/outgoing traffic, safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL:
Secure communication is enabled through HTTPS, with SSL/TLS encryption keeping your data private and secure.

5. Load-Balancer:
Large websites use load-balancers to evenly distribute traffic among multiple servers, optimizing performance.

6. Web Server:
The web server processes HTTP requests, retrieves resources, and sends them back to your browser.

7. Application Server:
For dynamic content, an application server executes logic, retrieves data, and generates content for the web server.

8. Database:
If needed, the application server communicates with a database server to retrieve required data.
